# Financial-News-Headlines-Sentiments-Analysis

This is a data mining project. There are three goals of this project.

First, I want to find the characteristics of securities derived from social media factors have significant power in explaining the time-series variation in daily returns. The Social Media Factor, the “sixth” factor, is distinct from the traditional five factors authored by Fama and French.

Second, I predict excess return using sentiment scores and Fama-French factors, as well as understand what features explain the variance the most.

Third,  I want to xxplore how our extracted sentimental scores are related or affecting the fluctuations of stock returns.

In this project, I applied several data mining and machine learning techniques.
1. Fin-BERT and LSTM NLP models that convert text into sentiment scores.
2. Fama-French model with social media as the six factor
3. PCA dimension reduction
4. data wrangling/feature engineering/model engineering
5. K-mean clustering
6. Regression models: linear, SVR, decision tree, random forest, bagging, voting, gradient boosting and ada boost.
